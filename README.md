# Lynx

![link list](https://cdn.jackbailey.dev/screenshots/lynx.png)

## About

A fullstack application using the MEVN stack to shorten your URLs.

I've tried a variety of URL shorteners but didn't find any with the functionality I wanted so I made my own.

My functionality I wanted:

-   Admin Interface
-   Option to redirect the root path
-   Simple UI

A mirror of this repository is available at [git.jackbailey.uk](https://git.jackbailey.uk/Lynx-Shortener/Lynx)

## Installation

Installation has moved to [the docs](https://docs.getlynx.dev/installation/installation).
## Development/Contribution

I'm actively using and trying to add features/fix bugs with Lynx, I'm just busy.

You're welcome to make a PR adding any features/fixing any issues and I'll merge them.

The Roadmap is accessible [here](https://github.com/orgs/Lynx-Shortener/projects/2)

## Naming

Each item including a slug, destination and id is called a [`Link`](src/db/models/link.js), the plural being links.

Each link has a `slug`, this is the path in the source url. `example.com/2dch89772`'s slug would be `2dch89772`.

Each item including a username and password is called an [`Account`](src/db/models/account.js), the plural being accounts.
