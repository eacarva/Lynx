## I Have a Question

> Before asking a question, please read the available [Documentation](https://docs.getlynx.dev) first.

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/Lynx-Shortener/Lynx/issues) that might help you. If you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, please write your question in the existing issue (Even if closed).

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Lynx-Shortener/Lynx/issues/new).
- Use a template and provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Lynx, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://docs.getlynx.dev) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/Lynx-Shortener/Lynx/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

### Code Contribution

1. Set up your environment
    
    Follow the docs at https://docs.getlynx.dev/installation/installation/native.

2. Make your changes, ensuring linters pass
3. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
4. Don't worry about updating CHANGELOG.md or VERSION. We'll sort it out later.


### Improving The Documentation

The documentation uses GitBook, you may be able to edit it through their site, otherwise the repo is at https://github.com/Lynx-Shortener/docs.
